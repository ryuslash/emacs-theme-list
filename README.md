This is a utility to generate screenshots for any themes for [Emacs]
and a Jekyll site to showcase these screenshots. The idea is to be
able to easily and quickly preview themes in modes that I use a lot so
I can better decide if I like a theme or not, and also as inspiration
for my own theme.

# Sources

The code I use is copied from other projects. If it's not alright that
I'm using this, please let me know. If you know a more interesting
looking piece of code, please let me know. This is where I got the
code from:

- **emacs-lisp-mode**: Featuring parts of the utility used to generate
  the screenshots, bin/try-emacs-themes.

- **haskell-mode**: Copied the code from the screenshots in the
  [emacs-color-themes] README.

- **ruby-mode**: Copied some code from [a post from Emacs Redux],
  which seems to feature some part of [RuboCop].
